# Logistic Regression and Nive Bayes
I have implemented Logistic Regression and Nive Bayes algorithms using Python.

Logistic Regression is a statistical method used to predict a binary outcome (i.e., yes/no or true/false) based on one or more predictor variables. It is a linear model that calculates the probability of a certain outcome by applying a logistic function to a linear combination of input features. Logistic Regression is a simple and fast algorithm that works well for large datasets and can handle non-linear relationships between input features.
On the other hand, Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm based on Bayes' theorem, which calculates the probability of a certain outcome given the input features. Naive Bayes is called "naive" because it assumes that all input features are independent of each other, which is not always the case in real-world applications. Despite this assumption, Naive Bayes can perform well in many situations, especially when there are many input features.

In this program, I have used a dataset entailing some patients' symptoms and Diabetes diagnoses.
